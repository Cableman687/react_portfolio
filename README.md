# React Portfolio (In-Progress)

## Description

- Bring a Web Developer means being part of a community. This portfolio was built as a place to showcase my projects, but also as a way to share my work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.
- By creating this portfolio, it allows for all of my projects to be showcased using a platform outside of Github and as a result provides a greater user experience when navigating my career profile.
- By building this app, it has allowed me to learn (and demonstrate) my skills in React and web-design, including but not limited to: Rendering, Props, Components, States, Event Handling, Hooks, Data-Fetching, Styling and Testing.
