      <p>
      I am a Full Stack Developer and C++ enthusiast on a learning journey of nearly three years.
       As a Programmer I am always ready to jump into new challenges and create clean, elegant solutions to complex problems.
        I have completed many projects showcasing my skills across a range of different technologies including C++, JavaScript, HTML, SQL, CSS and many others.
         I believe that my background in Mining, Projects and Finance also allows me to understand some of the largest industries in Australia, and
          tackle industry-specific problems in ways that other developers may not.
